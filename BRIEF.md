# The Program

We're going to create a simple command line app that plans a user's journey on the London Underground.

* The program prompts the user for a starting station
* The program prompts a user for the end station
* The program figures out the number of stops between the stations
* The program figures out each of the stops between the stations and prints out the entire route

# The Tube

We'll keep things simple. We'll start with a simplified verison of the Victoria, Bakerloo and Central lines, with one intersection at Oxford Circus between them.

Victoria Line: Kings Cross, Euston, Warren Street, Oxford Circus, Green Park, Victoria, Pimlico

Bakerloo Line: Elephant & Castle, Lambeth North, Waterloo, Embankment, Charing Cross, Picadilly Circus, Oxford Circus, Regent's Park, Baker Street.

Central Line: Notting Hill Gate, Queensway, Lancaster Gate, Marble Arch, Bond Street, Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road, Holborn, Chancery Lane.

# TODO

1. Define suitable data structures for the underground lines and stations.

2. Create a text-based program that prompts the user for their starting line, then prints out the stations available to choose from.

3. Add code to allow the user to select a starting station.

4. Add code to prompt the user for an ending line.

5. Add code to prompt the user for an ending station.

6. Print out the number of stops between the two stations.

7. Print out the actual station stops between the two stations on the screen.

# TIPS

1. Get the program working for a single line before trying multiple lines.

2. Map out in your mind or on paper or the whiteboard how the lines are set out and the intersection.

3. What data structures would be best to store the lines? Which would be best to store the stations?

4. What does the Ruby Array API intersect method do?
